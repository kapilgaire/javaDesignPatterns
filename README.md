# Design Patterns

## [Singleton design Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-singleton-design-pattern-practices-examples/)

The singleton design pattern is used to restrict the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the JVM. In other words, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time per JVM instance.

## [Decorator design Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decorator-pattern/)

Decorator design patterns allow us to add functionality to an object (not the class) at runtime, and we can apply this customized functionality to an individual object based on our requirement and choice.

## [Factory design Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-patterns-set-2-factory-method/)

Factory method is a creational design pattern, i.e., related to object creation. In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to client and the client use the same common interface to create new type of object.

## [Observer design Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/observer-pattern-set-1-introduction/)

Observer watch for any change in state or property of subject.  Suppose you are interested in particular object and want to get notified when its state changes then you observe that object and when any state or property change happens to that object,it get notified to you.

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
